"This project's dataset is provided by Torob, including a portion of the real data from this website. As you know, Torob is a shopping search engine that aggregates product information from various online stores and displays it on a single page. This allows users to easily find their desired product and compare different sellers. One of the most critical technical requirements for such a platform is the automatic detection of product information, as manual curation of this massive volume of data and extraction of information from them would be extremely time-consuming and costly. Product categorization can arguably be considered the most important information for a product, as it plays a crucial role in its searchability. Therefore, in this project, we assist Torob by designing a deep learning model that can classify products based on their images."
